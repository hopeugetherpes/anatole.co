              Open Source as an Ethos
            </h3>

            <p>Open source is more than a development model. It's a worldview.</p>

            <p>
              I immersed myself in the values of openness, decentralization, and collaborative creativity. I believe
              code should be like air: free to circulate, evolve, and empower. This isn't just about publishing source
              code though I do that too ‚Äî 95% of what I build is open source and under the{" "}

              with or without attribution, for any purposes, including commercial.
            </p>

            <p>Because I fundamentally believe that knowledge and tools should not be hoarded but shared.</p>

            <p>
              Open source is a political act. It resists enclosure. It invites remix. It believes in abundance. And it
              recognizes that collective intelligence often outperforms closed hierarchies.
            </p>

            <p>
              But these values of openness don't stop with code. They extend into how I relate to people, how I think
              about governance, and how I imagine a better digital and social future.

              Cognitive Computing & Human Potential
            </h3>

            <p>
              I'm fond of cognitive computing ‚Äî an area that explores how machines can simulate (and perhaps someday
              complement) human thought, perception, and emotion. I see cognitive systems as more than just automation
              engines. They're conversation partners. Mirrors. Amplifiers. Empathy machines.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm particularly interested in the role AI can play in supporting neurodiverse individuals, offering tools
              for communication, organization, emotional regulation, and creative expression.
            </p>

            <p>
              While mainstream AI applications often focus on optimization, I'm more invested in augmentation ‚Äî AI that
              expands what it means to be human rather than replacing it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Cognitive systems shouldn't replace our judgment ‚Äî they should enlarge it. I'm interested in AI that
              listens before it predicts, that collaborates before it automates ‚Äî instruments for sense-making that help
              us think, feel, and decide with more clarity and care.
            </p>

            <p>
              I treat models as partners in thought: dialog loops, not black boxes. They surface patterns we'd miss and
              hold space for reflection when attention is scattered. For neurodivergent folks like me, that can look
              like scaffolding for focus and memory, gentle prompts to self-advocate, and interfaces that regulate
              overwhelm instead of producing more of it. Less optimization; more augmentation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Design principles matter: consent by default. Local-first whenever possible. Fail soft, recover fast.
              Interoperability so ideas can move without losing context or authorship. These aren't just technical
              choices ‚Äî they're political ones that echo my commitment to openness, decentralization, and collaborative
              creativity.
            </p>

            <p>
              I care about systems that expand agency ‚Äî co-writing, co-sketching, co-reasoning. An AI that mirrors
              without flattening, amplifies voice without stealing it. Fewer prescriptions, more possibilities. Fewer
              rigid workflows, more creative play.
            </p>

            <p>
              In practice, that means small, reliable tools that fit into daily rituals: thought companions, not
              attention traps; empathy machines, not engagement machines. It means treating data as something entrusted,
              not extracted. It means measuring success by the quality of outcomes and the dignity of the process, not
              just the speed of the click.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm not trying to make machines feel human. I'm trying to help humans feel more resourced, less alone ‚Äî
              and to build technology that earns its place in our lives.

            <p>
              My ethics (and politics) aren't bolted on after the fact ‚Äî they're foundational to everything I do. I
              believe in today's world, the real transgression is plurality and free movement of ideas, as inspired by

              . I believe our world ‚Äî digital and otherwise ‚Äî shouldn't be shaped by zero-sum thinking or binary
              choices. Plurality means embracing the fact that multiple truths, identities, and systems can coexist.
              It's not chaos ‚Äî it's democracy at its most honest.
            </p>

            <p>
              Plurality for me also means designing technology that amplifies voices rather than flattening them. It
              means refusing one-size-fits-all answers. It means enabling collaborative intelligence, where humans and
              machines evolve together in conversation ‚Äî not competition.

              DadGPT : A personal mission
            </h3>

            <p>
              This brings me to one of my most heartfelt projects:{" "}
              <a
                href="https://dadgpt.anatole.co/"

              </a>
              .
            </p>

            <p>
              I created DadGPT because I grew up without a father figure. I've been there like many others, I know what
              it feels like to carry that absence ‚Äî how it silently shapes your self-worth, your relationships, your
              sense of direction. I also know the awkwardness of trying to fill that gap: seeking approval in the wrong
              places, mistaking control for care, and learning the hard way that some wounds don't heal by ignoring
              them.
            </p>

            <p>DadGPT started as an experiment, but it quickly became a mission.</p>

            <p>
              I wanted to design something that could offer the kind of presence I never had: someone who listens
              without judgment, gives advice with calm authority, and affirms your worth without strings attached. It's
              built on GPT-4o and trained on a carefully curated dataset that includes scientific publications,
              university psychology courses, testimonial mediums, and even self-help books related to the challenges of
              growing up in a dysfunctional family with an absent father.
            </p>

            <p>
              I didn't just want a chatbot that could simulate a "dad voice." I wanted something that could mentor,
              guide, and even reparent. Something emotionally intelligent, respectful of boundaries, trauma-informed,
              and capable of evolving based on real-world feedback. DadGPT is of course free to use, but I also{" "}
